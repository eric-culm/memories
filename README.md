## Description

Reckon is an algorithmic system aimed at making tangible, in acoustic terms, the dream of an Artificial Intelligence.
The audio information is entirely generated by a digital dreaming apparatus. Inside the latter, the psychic operations of sensorial memories re-elaboration, proper of human dreaming, are substituted with purely mathematical operations between digitalized sensorial stimuli.

Reckon exploits the cooperation between algorithms: a system able to stock and analyze acoustic stimuli to generate acoustic memories and a parallel mechanism that re-elaborates and organizes these memories, building oneiric textures.

On the one hand, a neural network model called SampleRNN analyzes audio data collections to learn how to reconstruct the essence of the experienced stimuli (for example piano or guitar).
The mathematical procedure at the basis of this model, as well as the resulting sound, has much in common with the process through which we are able to mentally recall a perceptual experience, evoking its salient characteristics but omitting its meticulous details.
In fact, the sound elements present in Reckon resemble blurred memories, remotely evoking the main characteristics of musical instruments and natural soundscapes, but discarding their most accurate elements that would make them real.

On the other hand a semi-entropic apparatus controls SampleRNN and selects, re-elaborates, concatenate and overlaps sound memories to compose digital audio dreams. To perform this operation, the system auto-defines a hierarchy of complex semi-random rules through which create a semantic evolution of the sound material in a similar way to how happens in human biologic dreams.
